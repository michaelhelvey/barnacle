## Day 2 (4/26/24): Day 2 of Figuring how to boot linux

When I left off last time, I had some files, and I needed to try and turn them into a bootable
image.

I had a better idea since last time than just tryand figure out from scratch what's going on here,
why don't I download one of the images from their download page and see what's in there?

I'm not very familiar with the macos commands for all this, so I think what I'll do is spin a docker
container with linux in it, and mount my local directory into it, so I can use familiar linux
commands.

```shell
docker run --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --privileged --name osdev -v ./:/var/project -d --rm -it ubuntu:latest /bin/bash
```

Now I can `docker exec` into that and have linux commands, like `fdisk` that work in the expected
way.

I grabbed a "Raspberry PI OS Lite" image from the official downloads page, and now I can inspect it:

```shell
root@0af89a5fdacb:/var/project# unxz ./2024-03-15-raspios-bookworm-armhf-lite.img.xz
root@0af89a5fdacb:/var/project# fdisk -l ./2024-03-15-raspios-bookworm-armhf-lite.img

```

Ok, so we have a boot partition and a a linux partition, that makes sense. Let's see what's in the
boot partition first, since that's what we're trying to build here.

```shell
root@0af89a5fdacb:/var/project# mount -v -o offset=4194304 ./2024-03-15-raspios-bookworm-armhf-lite.img /mnt/rasp
mount: /dev/loop1 mounted on /mnt/rasp.

Ok, so we have one file for every imaginable machine could theoretically boot using this, but that
tells us quite a bit, honestly. For one thing, `config.txt` is empty, so apparently that's fine. I
think the next thing to do is try and create a bootable disk partition of my directory and start it
with qemu. Without a OS partition with all the required linux stuff, I'm guessing that the kernel
won't really _do_ anything when we start it, but hey, we can verify that we've made some progress
towards understanding how a PI boots.

Definitely going to be doing some googling here like I do every time I have to use the `dd` command
to build boot partitions, which is about every 3 years.

```shell

root@0af89a5fdacb:/var/project# mkdir /mnt/prep/
root@0af89a5fdacb:/var/project# mount -o loop boot.img /mnt/prep/
```

After some copying and an `unmount`, I now in theory should have a FAT32 formatted boot sector for
use with qemu.

Back on my main machine, and some more googling to find the relevant qemu arguments, here goes
nothing:

```shell
‚ùÆ qemu-system-aarch64 -machine raspi3b -cpu cortex-a53 -nographic -dtb bcm2710-rpi-3-b.dtb -m 1G -smp 4 -kernel kernel8.img -sd boot.img -append "rw earlyprintk loglevel=8 console=ttyS0 dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootdelay=1" -device usb-net,netdev=net0 -netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22

```

Hmm, well, hey, it executed code. Doesn't seem like the kernel booted though. If I remove the usb
device from qemu, it writes nothing at all...maybe a bad DTB file? I'm also don't have any overlays
in my boot image either, so that seems problematic, since apparently it's the job of the `start.elf`
code to combine one of these files with the appropriate base device tree. I'll just dive back into
my docker container and copy some more overlays and dtb files into my boot image in the hope that I
get some ones that work on this qemu device.

Well, that didn't work either. Even booting the official image with no modifications produced the
same result. Clearly I'm doing something wrong, and I need to stop googling and try to understand
what I'm doing a little better. There's a lot of garbage in those kernel parameters, and I suspect
that I'm not getting kernel output on the right tty, perhaps?

Overall not as much progress I would have liked today, but at least I'm creating and _trying_ to
boot some stuff on qemu.
